- Look for diff binary in PATH if not present in cwd.
- Throw up an error message if diff refused to run or it's missing.
- Do directory comparisons.
- Do file comparison when two files are selected (don't make user hit F5 the
  first time).
- File selection dialog box blows...I want my GTK+ standard file dialog.
- Initial window is way too small on X11 and Aqua. Shouldn't have to resize
  (maybe a more sane default and store last window coordinates to the
  registry/config file).
- File scrolling is extremely expensive and has significant impact on user
  experience...might be overdraw, since it seems to be worse over X11 than
  on a local machine.
- Don't like having to click the "..." buttons to select each file after
  clicking the "2 way diff" button...should probably just go straight to
  file dialog.
- Want to specify files from the command line for merging (need this for
  Perforce, etc).
- More to come.
